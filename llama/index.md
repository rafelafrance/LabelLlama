# The menagerie of scripts

Note that these scripts are under heavy development and they will change and
some will be deleted.

## annotate_fields.py

This is a GUI script that I use to create training or testing data for what text
goes into each Darwin Core field captured by a language model.

## build_char_sub_matrix.py

This build the character substitution matrix for multiple sequence alignments on
lines of text. This is directly analogous to the PAM250 matrix when doing a
multiple sequence alignment on proteins. The difference is that I'm not measuring
how difference amino acids are, but how similar characters look. The process is not
as complicated as it may look.

## cutout_labels.py

This is a GUI script for generating test or training data for the label finder model.
